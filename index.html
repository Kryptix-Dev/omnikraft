            **NOTES BY KRYPTIX
            If anyone who is reading this a member, I'll leave some notes as comments in this page.  Look for the **, that will signify my commentary.
            The reason I created this page to replace the forum is to act as a memorial for all the memories we've all made together as well as to ensure
            that for anyone who wants to keep playing on a save and fun Minecraft server, that they know where to go.  The interest to start VentureKraft
            came from garathor who didn't want the community to disappear.  Most of the staff shared their interest to continue operations, especialy
            TheGreatNaj who took on the responsibility of being the new owner.  I hope that a fresh start will be good for the community.  I know many will
            be upset by the decision for me to step down.  When I announced to the staff team, a few thought that I would be running this until the end of
            time! XD  As much as I would like to, there is a time where I have to focus on other things in my life.  As is my nature though, I can't just
            walk away.  When garathnor said he wanted to continue, I offered my help to start the next leg of the journey.  I'll never disappear from this
            community, at least not until I die, you all mean way too much for me.  I've learned so much from so many of you, I am eternally grateful for
            that.  If given the choice, I would do this again in a heartbeat.  There were many times that were a struggle for me, but it was all worth it
            when so many of you would say that this made a difference to them in their lives.  I'm happy to be a part of that.  I hope all of you who get
            to read this will take the opportunity that this new adventure brings to push yourselves and get out of your comfort zones.  That is the only
            way you'll really grow.

						<h2 class="major">Our Beginnings</h2>
						<p>The saying when one door closes-another opens-is a perfect analogy for the start of OmniKraft.  When the NewKraft owner suddenly shutdown the server in May 2013, Shrimpyzillaa and I as co-owners, and the lead admin Jon1Rocks, worked together to create OmniKraft to continue to provide a server for all the players on NewKraft.  OmniKraft officially launched on June 16, 2013.  After Jon1Rocks and Shrimpyzillaa moved on from the community, MrPeppah took on the role of co-owner in March 2015 to help me keep OmniKraft operating.  There have been many changes and struggles for the community during it's lifetime.  After four years of service, I decided it was time to pass on the torch of leading the community, TheGreatNaj choose to carry that torch with VentureKraft.</p>
						<h4>NewKraft (Feb 2012-May 2013) >  OmniKraft (June 2013-June 2017) >  VentureKraft</h4>

						**NOTES BY KRYPTIX
						This analogy has been one I've used several times throughout the time of OmniKraft.  That is because it applied
						to everyone and every situation.  Starting with those who had to step away from the community to take care of 
						situations in their life to those who were banned for breaking the rules.  The only thing that is constant in life
						is that it changes.  Nothing lasts forever and nothing stays constant forever.  It can be upsetting and exhillerating
						when a big change happens.  It can be scary or hurtful.  Whatever it is at that day, it will be different tomorrow.
						I do want to say to everyone that this has been a hard decision for me.  I've thought quite a few times in the last
						several months about shutting things down, but I just couldn't because it didn't feel right to me.  This time, it did.
						That is because I've seen many in the community step up to the plate to offer something to the community.  Be it towns
						to help new members feel like they found a friend, to starting up a gaming group on Discord to help get everyone together
						to play games together.  I feel the community as a whole has matured to the point that I need to step aside and let those
						ambitions come to fruition!  I don't want to hold anyway back, which means I need to let the idea of OmniKraft grow in
						the directions anyone can take it.

						<h2 class="major">The Next Adventure - VentureKraft</h2>
						<p>When Kryptix announced his choice to step down, the staff of OmniKraft immediately rallied to continue work of offering a safe and fun Minecraft experience for the members.  garathnor shared his idea of the next server, VentureKraft, and the rest of the staff followed, especially TheGreatNaj who took on the responsibility of ownership.  The name came about to show that this will be a new direction for the community and to allow for more flexibility without the pressure of expectation that OmniKraft built up.  Upon seeing the drive from the OmniKraft staff team to continue, Kryptix offered his services as a consultant to be a co-founder of VentureKraft and ensure it has the best chance to succeed!</p>

						I picked the picture for this slide for two reasons.  First is because garathnor has choosen to use the airshop to be a symbol
						of this change.  By having it at spawn and loading it with supplies, it gives all members a physical structure to help process
						their feelings of letting go to OmniKraft and looking forward to the next adventure.  What better way to symbolize adventure than
						with flight?

						<h2 class="major">Time for Something Different</h2>
						<p>As a way to still offer something to the community, Kryptix started up OmniGamers.  It's a Discord group around gaming, but not just Minecraft.  There are regularly scheduled events to get everyone together to play and various chat rooms to discuss various topics.  We hope to see you there!</p>

						<h2 class="major">A Special Thanks to You</h2>
						<p>When OmniKraft opened, it was never expected that the community would grow into what it did.  OmniKraft wouldn't be where it was without you!  While the community is large, what made it special was each individual who joined.  Each member who joined was welcomed, and in turn, they welcomed the next member.  Everybody helping each other out, becoming friends and being a family.  All your support with voting, with donations and sharing it to your friends and providing feedback is what really helped us get to where we where.  Regardless if you choose to find a new server to play or decided to join us on VentureKraft, we hope you'll keep the memories and all the friends you made here with you wherever you go!</p>
						<p>We look forward to all of you joining us on our next adventure and seeing where things go!</p>

						While I am the ultimate caretaker of the community, it is you, the member, that is what made the community as special as it was.
						I know it sounds cliche, I've seen and heard this term thrown around a lot in mainstream media, but at OmniKraft, it's true.
						It is you, the member, who sent us your hard-earned money to help keep the lights on.  It is you, the member, who joined the
						server everyday to talk to everyone and to help.  It is you, the member, who welcomed each new member to the server.  Even though
						everyone gives me credit for the success of OmniKraft, that success means nothing if you aren't on the server to enjoy it.  In the
						picture, I only included a fraction of notable members who had helped with the community.  I wish I could include more, and/or
						remember all their names. XD  The last goes from left to right, foreground to background.

						<p>I of course also want to give a thanks to everyone who was part of the staff team.  This includes the staff who were around when we changed direction as well as to staff who had to move on or were demoted.  Each one of you brought something special to the team, which ensure we provided the best experience to the community.  I would have lost my mind and the drive to continue for four years if it wasn't for you, I just wish I could give you more for your service.</p>

							Expanding on the above topic, there is no way I could have done this alone.  Every single staff member that has been a part of this
							crazy ride (and I mean that in every possible sense of the word), has done their part.  Even those that we did have to demote, they
							each imparted knowledge and wisdom to me and the other staff members on how to do the best job we can.  It does come down to the
							effort that each member of this team put in that built the reputation that OmniKraft earned.  I provided the direction, and you were
							the one to what you could do each and every day that OmniKraft operated.  The picture in the background is a group shot with everyone
							except MrPeppah and myself.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to include the heads of the staff as well, but I choose to do so just so they
							can receive the credit they deserve.
